Given a binary tree of size N, your task is to that find all duplicate subtrees from the given binary tree.

Example:

Input :

```
Output : 2 4
         4
```
Explanation: Above Trees are two 
duplicate subtrees.i.e  and 
Therefore,you need to return above trees 
root in the form of a list.

Your Task:

You don't need to take input. Just complete the function printAllDups() that takes the root node as a parameter and returns an array of Node*, which contains all the duplicate subtree.
Note: Here the Output of every Node printed in the Pre-Order tree traversal format.


Constraints:

1<=T<=100

1<=N<=100
