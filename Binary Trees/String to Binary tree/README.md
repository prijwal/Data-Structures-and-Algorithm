Given a string s consisting of parentheses {‘(‘ and ‘)’} and integers, the task is to construct a Binary Tree from it and print its Preorder traversal.

Examples:
```
Input: S = “1(2)(3)”
Output: 1 2 3
Explanation: The corresponding binary tree is as follows:
            1
          /   \                      
        2      3                       

Input: “4(2(3)(1))(6(5))”
Output: 4 2 3 1 6 5
Explanation:
The corresponding binary tree is as follows:

              4
           /     \                  
          2        6          
        /  \      /                         
       3    1    5                       

```
